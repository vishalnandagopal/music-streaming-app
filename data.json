Got a long list of ex-lovers, They'll tell you I'm insane. 'Cause you know I love the players, And you love the game. 'Cause we're young and we're reckless, We'll take this way too far. It'll leave you breathless, Or with a nasty scar. Got a long list of ex-lovers, They'll tell you I'm insane. But I've got a blank space baby, And I'll write your name."
